## Goal of the APP DEV INNOVATION Program for FEMALES in the ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM over Generations

The goal is to show all Females of any generation, that anything is possible also in the area of Tech and to lit the fire in each of every Female to find the spark in Tech. We want to connect all generations of Females whether it's pupils, university students or professionals already performing in jobs. Further we want to connect those generations which haven't gotten in touch with Tech yet. Since we noticed that there is a huge gap between the communities and there aren't enough Female Tech Heroes. 

But you can start at any age, so we thought of starting with a commonality: building an App on our phone which can take pictures and which we can talk to or in other (tech) words: how to build a progressive Web App on our Phone which uses pre-trained machine learning models as restful endpoints. The Application uses REST APIs and we will use Azure to meet the challenge to get it running.
To close the gap we will first start with getting the application to run and then secondly integrate the ML REST APIs. As a place where we can create our Tech Dreams, we will use Github to create our space of collaboration, as our motto always is: Sharing is Caring!

## Goal of the APP DEV INNOVATION Program for FEMALES in the ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM over Generations Training Days 

On Day 1 we will create our own Github Account and use this repository as our baseline. We will then use Azure Web Apps to host our Application. Further we play a bit around with the frontend to change our personal Headlines for our App and to understand the basic underlying concept of Azure. Further we will use Azure Functions to automate our tasks. Storages and Databases are used to store our Images or our data. All those Azure Services are used behind the scenes and can be consumed by our application aka personal App.


On Day 2 we will stay in the developer view by using our existing personal App and our goal is to make it smart with pre-trained machine models behind the scenes. For this we will focus on our managed services like Azure Cognitive Services: Face API and Speech API. As a future developer I can use those REST APIs and enrich my applications without having deep ml expert knowledge.
As final challenge you will connect your application with the services.  This shows the entire lifecycle and brings together best of both worlds.

Afterwards the trainers will suggest a long list of online courses to get started and to get a deeper dive into the Technologies.
Further all the FemaleTechGen graduates are invited to join our [AI Developer College](https://github.com/aidevcollege/aidevcollege) or [Azure Developer College](https://github.com/azuredevcollege/trainingdays).
